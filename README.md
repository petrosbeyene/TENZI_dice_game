# TENZI DICE GAME
## Description

Tenzi is the fast-paced and frenzied dice-rolling game for 2-4 players. The concept is simple, the game-play is lightning fast, and the fun is immediate.
Each player is given 10 dice, and the objective of the game is to roll the dice as fast as possible, the player who gets all dice on the same number and yells "Tenzi!" is the winner. Here I have customized it so that it could be played solo. Here the challenges are to have the **_best time Score_** and **_few number of rolles_**.

## Game rule
The game rule is quite simple- **Roll all ten of your dice to the same number with the least possible time and number of rolles.** .

## How to Run
It is entirely built with **_React js_** so, it is easy to clone and can run on any latest browser.
